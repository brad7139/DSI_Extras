This character must be at the end of the first line when defining a function (A) : 

This method will transform a sparse matrix to a dense matrix (A) .todense()

This hyperparameter controls the strength of regularization (A) alpha

In order to check that two values are equivalent, this/these operational character(s) are used in Python (A) ==

This word is used to describe any random variable that is countable by integers (A) Discrete

$400

`.map()` is a method available with this data type (A) Pandas Series, Series

In an sklearn LogisticRegression classifier model, this is the default scoring metric of the object (A) Accuracy

If a model scores very well on it's training set, but much more poorly on the testing set, the model is likely suffering from this (A) Overfit, overly complex, etc.

This Pandas method will return a boolean DataFrame or Series indicating whether or not a value is np.nan (A) .isnull()

In an sklearn train_test_split, the proportional size of the testing set can be controlled by assigning this argument (A) test_size, train_size

$600

The 'l1' penalty is more commonly known as this form of regularization (A) Lasso

At the 95% significance level, A null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternate accepted, when this value is below 0.05 (A) p-value

In a K Nearest Neighbors classifier, this distance metric is also the shortest distance between two points in vector space (A) Euclidean

This distribution is representative of a single experiment with a binomial outcome (A) Bernoulli

The sklearn object train_test_split returns 4 objects, in exactly this order (A) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

$800

This numpy function will quickly create an array of numbers, given a beginning value, ending value, and step value (A) np.arange

The classification metric recall is more commonly known as this (A) Sensitivity

This method of dealing with imbalanced classes involves dropping observations of the majority class to obtain a balanced dataset (A) Undersampling

This distance-based model is one of the only non-parametric models we've learned thus far (A) K-Nearest Neighbors, KNN

The classification metric "True Negative Rate" is more commonly known as this (A) Specificity

$1000

This is the link function that bends a Linear Regression into a Logistic Regression (A) Logit Function

This is the term describing when a set of random variables have approximately the same finite variance (A) homoscedacity

From classification metrics, The C in ROC (A) Characteristic

This is the term for describing two highly correlated features (A) Multicollinear

Naive Bayes is considered 'naive' because of this assumption (A) Independence of features
